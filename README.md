Artifex is an AI-driven engineering tool that acts as a copilot designed to simplify CAD workflows by enabling natural language-driven design. With **Artifex**, you can describe your ideas in plain English, and it will translate them into complex 3D CAD models within FreeCAD. Built as a macro, Artifex leverages state-of-the-art APIs like OpenAI and Claude to provide real-time design assistance.

## ðŸ›  Installation & Setup

1. **Install FreeCAD**  
   Download and install FreeCAD from the [official website](https://www.freecadweb.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Artifex.git
   cd Artifex
   ```

3. **Set Up API Keys**  
   Obtain API keys for the required service:
   - OpenAI API: [Sign up here](https://openai.com/).
   - Claude API: [Sign up here](https://www.anthropic.com/).

   Configure the keys as environment variables:
   ```bash
   api-key = "your-openai-key"
   api-key = "your-claude-key"
   ```

4. **Load the Macro in FreeCAD**  
   - Open FreeCAD and navigate to `Macro > Macros...`.
   - Load the `Artifex.FCMacro` file from the `src/` directory.
   - Click **Run** to start using Artifex.

##  How It Works
Artifex uses AI to process natural language inputs and generate 3D CAD models:
1. **Input Design**: You describe your design in text, such as:  
   *"Create two spheres (20mm diameter) connected by a cylinder (20mm diameter, 200mm height)."*
2. **AI Processing**: Artifex uses OpenAI or Claude to interpret your input and create a script for FreeCAD.
3. **Model Generation**: FreeCAD executes the script, generating a precise 3D model.
